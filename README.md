# Factor-Analysis-Mini-Project-Dow-Jones-Index
This project applies Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to weekly trends in the Dow Jones Industrial Index to uncover underlying patterns and predict future stock returns. Using a dataset of 750 records with variables such as stock prices, trading volumes, and percentage changes, the analysis identifies significant factors influencing stock performance. The project begins with adequacy tests, including the KMO and Bartlettâ€™s Test, ensuring the dataset's suitability for factor analysis. Key findings include identifying latent factors related to market sentiment, trading activity, volume changes, and price changes. The project compares Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods, concluding that the PCA model provides a better fit. Through CFA, the model's fit is further evaluated, demonstrating an acceptable representation of the data. This analysis offers valuable insights into the complex relationships within stock market data, aiding in more informed investment decisions.
